    TASK 3:
    Consider the event driven simulator Sim3 developed in Task 7 of the Practical Guide. Start by
    developing a new version of Sim3, named Sim3A, to estimate the same performance parameters
    as Sim3 and to consider that the link introduces a bit error rate given by b (which should be a
    new input parameter of Sim3A).
