## Overview
This repository contains the work for the Mini Project 1, part of the course MDRS (Modeling, Data, and System Representation) for the academic year 2024-2025. The project is divided into three main tasks, each organized in its respective directory, with accompanying MATLAB scripts and result images.

## Directory Structure
- **MiniProject1_MDRS_24_25.pdf**: The project brief or main guidelines document.
- **REPORT_MiniProject1.pdf**: The final report summarizing the methodology, results, and conclusions for each task.

### Task Directories
Each task directory contains MATLAB simulation files and result images.

- **TASK1/**
  - `task1.m`: Main MATLAB script for Task 1.
  - `Sim2.m`: Supporting simulation script.
  - Images (`1a.png`, `1b.png`, etc.): Visual results of simulations for Task 1.
  
- **TASK2/**
  - `task2.m`: Main MATLAB script for Task 2.
  - `Sim3.m`, `Sim3A.m`: Supporting simulation scripts.
  - Images (`2b.png`, `2c.png`, etc.): Visual results of simulations for Task 2.
  
- **TASK3/**
  - `task3.m`: Main MATLAB script for Task 3.
  - `Sim3.m`, `Sim4.m`, `Sim4A.m`: Supporting simulation scripts.
  - Images (`3a_apd.png`, `3a_pl.png`, etc.): Visual results of simulations for Task 3.
